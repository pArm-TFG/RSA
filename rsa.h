/*******************************************************************************
    RSA Algorithm
    Reminder: ((m**e)**d) % n = m
    e: encryption, d: decryption
    Encryption: ciphertext = message**e	% n
    Decryption: (c**d == (m**e)**d == m )	% n

    RSA Key Generation
    p and q, two distrinct prime numbers
    n = pq
    fi is Euler's Totient Function
    fi(n) = fi(p) * fi(q) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = n - (p + q - 1)

    chose e, the public key:
        - 1 < e < fi(n)
        - gcd(e, fi(n)) == 1 (i.e. e and fi(n) are coprime
    chose d, the private key:
        - d == e**-1 (mod fi(n))
        -> d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e (modulo(fi(n)))
